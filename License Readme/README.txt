Open options:
/pp or /pennpanels


Create new panel:
/pp new [PanelName]
*Note: You need to /reload to see the options for a new panel
*Note: Name the panel (e.g. /pp new Bottom Panel) so it is easier to track it in options. Typing only "/pp new" will assign a random number to the panel.


Move panel:
Shift Left Click


Delete Panel:
Right click -> Delete Panel


Hover over each module to see additional options (usually just left click to open the relevant panel/tab)



For the Memory/CPU Module: If you want to see CPU usage, you need to use "/console scriptProfile 1" and reload. Use 0 to disable again. Enabling CPU profiling may reduce game performance.
